This application is all about a simple e-commerce website with a simple UI, the menus are clickable but it would only refresh the website,
clicking the add to cart button would add that item to your shopping cart, showing what item it is, the quantity, and the total shopping cart items.
There's also a delete button beside the qty to remove the item entirely, which would update the shopping cart total.
This application utilizes react concepts such as main.jsx, app.jsx, and the component files. It also uses props, state management using useState Hook, event handling with onAdd and onDelete,
rendering using .map and .reduce, array methods like .find and .filter, spread operator (...), inline css.
